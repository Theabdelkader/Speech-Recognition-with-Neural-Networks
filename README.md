# Speech-Recognition-with-Neural-Networks
In this notebook, I will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline! My completed pipeline will accept raw audio as input and return a predicted transcription of the spoken language.

We begin by investigating the LibriSpeech dataset that will be used to train and evaluate your models. Your algorithm will first convert any raw audio to feature representations that are commonly used for ASR.
